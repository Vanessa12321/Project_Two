### **For Paper**

have a section that recreates what they did

-   commenting on the appropriateness of this
-   the following will go into that section:

## Write down the model that the authors used, in mathematical notation. Comment on the appropriateness of the models used by the authors in the study.

### Model Used:

$$
\text{TibiaAcc_Axial}_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{surfaceID}_{i} + \epsilon_i
$$

### **What They Did:**

-   averaged the results

-   conducted mutliple ANOVAs on the group means

    -   doing multiple ANOVAs could increase the likelihood of introducing a type 1 error

-   Bonferroni to reduce type 1 error

### **Appropriateness of one-way ANOVAs**

-   ANOVA tests assume normality, homogeneity of variance (equal variances), and independence of observations

    -   In this study, the assumption of independent observations is violated. observations across each surface from the same runner are not independent.

    -   By not taking this factor into account, the ANOVA treats each measurement as if they came from different people

        -   misleading results: the residual variance is inflated because individual variability isn't accounted for. Further, we can assume that the standard errors and p-values are also incorrect/misleading

### **Appropriateness of Bonferroni Correction**

-   The authors applied the Bonferroni Correction to control for the type 1 error introduced by the multiple one-way ANOVAs. In doing this, however, the method increases the type 2 error

-   Issue with this is that the Bonferroni Correction is much too conservative

-   Its conservativeness coupled with it being used on an already small sample size (n=15), BC likely overcorrects, making it difficult to produce statistically sound results.

    -   study starts out with low statistical power. Bonferroni, while controlling for type 1, lowers the statistical power even more, increasing type 2 error
